# sl3dge-utils

Little library of helper functions that I've built up over time and end up reusing on most projects.

sDebug.h > Memory leaks detection and Asserts
sImage.h > WIP .png files parser
sLinkedlist.h > WIP linked list. Need to make it type agnostic
sLogging.h > Various logging utils. Set the callbacks.
sMath.h > Vector, Matrix and Quaternion math
sModule.h > allow for hot reloading of .dll
sTypes.h > Shorthand typedefs for clarity
