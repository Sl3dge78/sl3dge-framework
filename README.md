# sl3dge-framework

Little framework of helper function that I've built up over time and end up reusing on most projects.

types.h > Shorthand typedefs for clarity  
3d_math.h > Vector, Matrix and Quaternion math  
debug.h > Memory leaks detection and Asserts  
module.h > allow for hot reloading of .dll
