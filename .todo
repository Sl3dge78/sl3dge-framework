    CRITICAL:
        - Fix loading, it still doesn't work in some cases. (multiple idats, check for 1.png)
        - Filter types 2 & 3 might not be working, test!
    MAJOR:
        - Clear the debug stuff
            - in huffman decode we loop through every entry to check for dupes, this isn't necessary
            - lengths checks
    BACKLOG:
        - Filter type 4
        - Uncompressed image (btype == 0)
        - Fixed table (btype == 1)
    IMPROVEMENTS:
        - Optimisations
            - Find an alternative to bitwapping
            - Improve the bitstream ?
            - Remove empty entries in the tables
            - HuffmanDecode : sort the table by size to avoid reading from the stream each loop
            - Let's try using a profiler to see how they work.
