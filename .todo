sProfiler:
    - Do that

sImage :
    CRITICAL:
        - Filter types 2 & 3 might not be working, test!
        - Filter type 4
    MAJOR:
    BACKLOG:
        - Uncompressed image (btype == 0)
        - Fixed table (btype == 1)
    IMPROVEMENTS:
        - Optimisations
            - Find an alternative to bitswapping
            - Improve the bitstream ?
            - Remove empty entries in the tables
            - HuffmanDecode : sort the table by size to avoid reading from the stream each loop
            - Let's try using a profiler to see how they work.
